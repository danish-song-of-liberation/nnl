## Customizing the Calculus System

By default, `nnl` uses `single-float` for all numerical computations.  However, you can easily change the calculus system to use a different floating-point type, such as `double-float`, to increase precision.

To change the calculus system, use the `nnl.system:change-calculus-system!` function.  This function accepts a single argument: a symbol representing the desired floating-point type.

**Example:**

To switch to using `double-float`:

```lisp
(nnl.system:change-calculus-system! 'double-float)
